# ChibiBooru

ChibiBooru is a self-hosted web application for organizing and browsing your local image collection, designed to automatically fetch tags and metadata from various online sources, similar to popular image boorus. It combines a user-friendly interface with powerful backend tools to create a rich and searchable media library.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
  * **🖼️ Elegant Image Gallery:** A responsive, masonry-style layout for browsing your images with infinite scroll.
  * **🤖 Automated Tagging:** Automatically fetches detailed, categorized tags for your images from multiple sources:
      * **Direct Hash Search:** Finds metadata from **Danbooru** and **e621** using the image's MD5 hash.
      * **Reverse Image Search:** Uses **SauceNao** to find sources and metadata when direct hash matching fails.
      * **AI Tagging:** Includes a local, ONNX-based AI tagger as a fallback to analyze and tag images that have no online matches.
  * **📂 Comprehensive Metadata:** Gathers rich metadata, including artist, character, copyright, species, and general tags, as well as image dimensions, file size, and original sources.

### Search & Discovery
  * **🔍 Advanced Search System:**
      * **Tag Search:** Search by tags with intelligent autocomplete suggestions
      * **Category-Specific Search:** Filter by tag category (e.g., `character:holo`, `copyright:spice_and_wolf`, `artist:name`)
      * **Full-Text Search:** Partial matching and fuzzy search for finding images even when you don't know exact tag names
      * **Negative Search:** Exclude tags with the `-` prefix (e.g., `-sketch` to exclude sketches)
      * **File Filters:** Search by filename (`filename:cute_cat`) or extension (`.png`, `.gif`)
      * **Source Filtering:** Find images from specific sources (`source:danbooru`)
      * **Relationship Filters:** Find parent/child images (`has:parent`, `has:child`, `has:relationship`)
      * **Pool Search:** Find images in specific collections (`pool:series_name`)
  * **🎯 Smart Similarity:** Weighted similarity matching that prioritizes rare tags and important categories (characters, copyright) over common descriptive tags

### Tag Management
  * **✏️ Full Tag Control:**
      * Intuitive in-line tag editor to add, remove, and recategorize tags
      * Ability to switch between different metadata sources (e.g., switch from Danbooru's tags to e621's for the same image)
      * Tag delta tracking preserves manual modifications across database rebuilds
  * **🔗 Tag Implications:** Automatic tag relationship detection and management:
      * **Smart Detection:** Automatically suggests implications based on naming patterns (e.g., `character_(series)` → `series`)
      * **Statistical Analysis:** Detects correlations between tags based on co-occurrence patterns
      * **Manual Control:** Create, approve, or delete implications with a dedicated management interface
      * **Chain Preview:** See the full impact of implications before applying them

### Organization
  * **📚 Pools:** Group related images into named collections with custom ordering
  * **🔗 Image Relationships:** Automatically detects and displays parent/child relationships between images

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Booru
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install Flask Pillow requests numpy onnxruntime torchvision python-dotenv tqdm
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    Copy the example environment file and customize it:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then edit `.env` with your settings. Key values to configure:

    ```env
    # REQUIRED: Security settings - change these!
    APP_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
    SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-for-sessions"  # Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
    RELOAD_SECRET="a-very-secret-string"

    # OPTIONAL: API keys for enhanced metadata fetching
    SAUCENAO_API_KEY="your_saucenao_api_key"  # Recommended for reverse image search
    GELBOORU_API_KEY=""
    GELBOORU_USER_ID=""

    # OPTIONAL: Customization
    APP_NAME="ChibiBooru"
    LOCAL_TAGGER_NAME="CamieTagger"
    SIMILARITY_METHOD="weighted"  # Options: 'jaccard' or 'weighted'
    ```

    **Important Security Notes:**
    - **REQUIRED:** Change `APP_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `RELOAD_SECRET` before first use
    - Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY` using: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
    - Never commit your `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
    - See `.env.example` for full configuration options and documentation

4.  **Place your images:**
    Move your image collection into the `static/images/` directory. You can create subdirectories to organize them.

5.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

      * `character:holo` - Find images with this character
      * `copyright:spice_and_wolf` - Find images from this series
      * `artist:artist_name` - Find images by this artist
      * `species:wolf` - Find images with this species tag
  * **Advanced Queries:**
      * `source:<name>` - Find images from a specific source (e.g., `source:danbooru`)
      * `filename:<text>` - Search for text within the image's filename
      * `.<ext>` - Filter by file extension (e.g., `.png`, `.gif`)
      * `has:parent` - Find images that have a parent
      * `has:child` - Find images that have children
      * `has:relationship` - Find images with any parent/child relationship
      * `pool:<name>` - Find images in a specific pool
      * `-<tag>` - Exclude a tag (e.g., `-sketch -monochrome`)
  * **Combine Multiple Filters:** Mix and match any of the above for powerful queries like:
      * `character:holo source:danbooru .png -sketch`

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Similarity Calculation Methods

ChibiBooru supports two similarity calculation methods, configurable via the `SIMILARITY_METHOD` environment variable:

- **`jaccard`** (default): Simple set intersection/union calculation. Fast and straightforward.
- **`weighted`**: Advanced method using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) and category weights. This method:
  - Prioritizes rare tags over common ones
  - Weights character and copyright tags higher than general descriptive tags
  - Provides more nuanced similarity matching for better recommendations

### Category Weights

When using weighted similarity, you can adjust category importance in `config.py`:

```python
SIMILARITY_CATEGORY_WEIGHTS = {
    'character': 5.0,   # Character matches are very significant
    'copyright': 3.0,   # Same series/franchise is important
    'artist': 2.0,      # Same artist style matters
    'species': 2.5,     # Species tags
    'general': 1.0,     # Standard descriptive tags
    'meta': 0.5         # Resolution, format, year - less relevant
}
```

### Custom AI Tagger Models

ChibiBooru supports any ONNX-based tagging model with compatible metadata:

1. Place your `model.onnx` and `metadata.json` files in `models/Tagger/`
2. Update `LOCAL_TAGGER_NAME` in `.env` to reflect your model
3. Adjust `LOCAL_TAGGER_THRESHOLD` in `config.py` if needed

## 🔧 Database Management

The application uses SQLite with several advanced features:

- **FTS5 Full-Text Search:** Fast partial matching and fuzzy search
- **Automatic Indexing:** Optimized queries for large collections
- **Tag Delta Tracking:** Preserves manual tag edits across rebuilds
- **Tag Implications:** Recursive tag relationships with chain support

To rebuild the FTS index if needed:
```bash
python database.py
```
